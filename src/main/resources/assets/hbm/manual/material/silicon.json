Created in an [[electric arc furnace|Electric Arc Furnace]] using things that contain silicon dioxide, like regular sand, nether quartz, fiberglass, flint or [[asbestos|Asbestos]]. Used primarily as wafers (i.e. billets) which are [[pressed|Burner Press]] using a circuit stamp, and then crafted into different types of microchips. Due to requiring an arc furnace, silicon is available after obtaining [[polymer|Polymer]], requiring [[oil|Crude Oil]] processing."
